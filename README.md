✨ **This workspace has been generated by [Nx, Smart Monorepos · Fast CI.](https://nx.dev)** ✨

## 🚀 Running the Project

This workspace was generated with Nx workspace 19.5.6 and Node 20.16.0.

### Steps

If you are using nvm, use the following commands:

```bash
nvm install 20.16.0
nvm use 20.16.0
```

💻Front End Dependencies

Position in the root folder and install with npm.

```bash
/nx-pillar-challenge/
npm install # inside the monorepo
```

🔙 Back End Dependencies

Position inside the back-end folder and install with npm:

```bash
/nx-pillar-challenge/
npm install # inside the monorepo
```

To run the back-end and front-end, you can use the Nx console extension for VS Code or run:

```bash
npx nx run back-end:serve
npx nx run front-end:serve
```

The front end will run on PORT: 4200 and the back end on 3000

## 📝 FYI

I would have liked to invest more time in styling, unit testing, deployment, and more interesting subjects. Unfortunately, this is the most time I can invest at the moment. I appreciate the opportunity to test myself with new technologies like Nx and to learn new things. I hope this project meets the qualifications.
